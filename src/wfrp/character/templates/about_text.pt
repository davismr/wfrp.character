<p>Ideally this is intended to be everything you could want to manage all of your
characters and campaigns for Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</p>
<p>The intention is for you to be able to run it locally, or use the online version.
    Check out the github repo, linked in the top right hand side.
</p>
<p>Currently it can do starting careers, spending experience, but you can't add experience yet,
and the only expansion that is added so far is <i>Rough Nights and Hard Day</i>.</p>
<p>Things I'm working on in the nearish future:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Campaigns</li>
    <li>Adding experience</li>
    <li>Import/export characters</li>
</ul>
