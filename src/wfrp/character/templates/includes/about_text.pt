<p>Ideally this is intended to be everything you could want to manage all of your
characters and campaigns for Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</p>
<p>The intention is for you to be able to run it locally, or use the online version.
    you just need python on your local machine and able to run some terminal commands.
    Instructions are in the readme.
    Check out the github repo, linked in the top right hand side.
</p>
<p>All core careers are added, and you can add experience and spend experience.
    The only expansions that are added so far is <i>Rough Nights and Hard Day</i>,
    and the Seafarer classes from <i>Sea of Claws</i>.</p>
<p>Things I'm working on in the nearish future:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Campaigns and expansions</li>
    <li>Fixing the pdf print out</li>
    <li>Import/export characters</li>
</ul>
